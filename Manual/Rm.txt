NAME
       rm - remove files

SYNOPSIS
       rm  FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each specified file.  By default, it does not remove directories.

       If  the  -I  or  --interactive=once  option is given, and there are more than three files or the -r, -R, or --recursive are given, then rm prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire
       operation.  If the response is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.

       Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the -f or --force option is not given, or the -i or --interactive=always option is given, rm prompts the user for whether to
       remove the file.  If the response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

       The full documentation for rm is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the info and rm programs are properly installed at your site, the command

              info coreutils 'rm invocation'

       should give you access to the complete manual.
