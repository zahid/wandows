NAME
	Bigger (>)
	
DESCRIPTION
	The greater than (>) character sends the output of an executable to a file
	instead of putting it on the screen. This is called output redirection.
	
EXAMPLE
	a.out > output1
	  OR
	g++ file.cpp >& output_and_errors
	  OR
	a.out >> output1
	
	The greater than (>) character sends the output of an executable to a file instead of putting it on the screen.
	This is called output redirection. For example, if the executable a.out above normally prints out "Hello, world!"
	on the screen, then the first example would cause nothing to appear on the screen, but instead, "Hello, world!"
	would be found in the file output1.

	Some output from programs is meant as error messages. Sometimes these will not be redirected by greater than (>).
	To redirect both regular and error output to a file, use the ampersand after the greater than symbol (i.e., >&),
	as in the second example.

	When you use output redirection, the first thing UNIX does is to create (or clear out, if it exists) the output file
	(e.g., output1 and output_and_errors in our examples). Be careful with this, since if you try to do something like:

		cat a b c > a
		
	You may run into problems since a gets cleared out (the "> a" part) before it is used (the "cat a b c" part).
