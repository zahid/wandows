NAME
     cal, ncal — displays a calendar and the date of Easter

SYNOPSIS
     cal

DESCRIPTION
     The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and ncal
     offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of Easter.  The
     new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80 termi-
     nal.  If arguments are not specified, the current month is displayed.

     A year starts on January 1.

SEE ALSO
     calendar(3), strftime(3)

HISTORY
     A cal command appeared in Version 5 AT&T UNIX.  The ncal command appeared
     in FreeBSD 2.2.6.  The output of the cal command is supposed to be bit
     for bit compatible to the original Unix cal command, because its output
     is processed by other programs like CGI scripts, that should not be bro‐
     ken. Therefore it will always output 8 lines, even if only 7 contain
     data. This extra blank line also appears with the original cal command,
     at least on Solaris 8
