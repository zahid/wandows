NAME
       dir - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       dir

DESCRIPTION
       List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

   Exit status:
       0      if OK,

       1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),

       2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

SEE ALSO
       The full documentation for dir is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the info and dir programs are properly installed at your site, the command

              info coreutils 'dir invocation'

       should give you access to the complete manual.
