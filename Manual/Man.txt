DESCRIPTION
       man is the system's manual pager. Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associated with each of these arguments is  then  found
       and displayed. A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order
       ("1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 5 4 9 6 7" by default, unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config), and to show only the first page found, even if page  exists  in  several
       sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

EXAMPLES
       man ls
 The  backup  suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected via the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment vari‚Äê
       able.  Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

SEE ALSO
       rename(2)

       The full documentation for mv is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the info and mv programs are properly installed at your site, the command

              info coreutils 'mv invocation'

       should give you access to the complete manual.
	   
DEFAULTS
       man will search for the desired manual pages within the index database caches. If the -u option is given, a cache consistency check is performed to ensure the databases  accurately  reflect  the
       filesystem.   If  this  option is always given, it is not generally necessary to run mandb after the caches are initially created, unless a cache becomes corrupt.  However, the cache consistency
       check can be slow on systems with many manual pages installed, so it is not performed by default, and system administrators may wish to run mandb every week or so to  keep  the  database  caches
       fresh.  To forestall problems caused by outdated caches, man will fall back to file globbing if a cache lookup fails, just as it would if no cache was present.

       Once a manual page has been located, a check is performed to find out if a relative preformatted `cat' file already exists and is newer than the nroff file.  If it does and is, this preformatted
       file is (usually) decompressed and then displayed, via use of a pager.  The pager can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default is used (see option -P  for  details).
       If no cat is found or is older than the nroff file, the nroff is filtered through various programs and is shown immediately.

       If a cat file can be produced (a relative cat directory exists and has appropriate permissions), man will compress and store the cat file in the background.

       The  filters are deciphered by a number of means. Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated. If -p was not used and the environment variable was
       not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid preprocessor string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable program mandb_nfmt (or mandb_tfmt  with  -t)
       exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets passed the manual source file, the preprocessor string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.
